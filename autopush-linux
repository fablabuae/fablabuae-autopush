# This script automate the "Push" process to Fabacademy Archive (for Manjaro linux and windows 10)
# Done by Eng Hashim Nabil Al Sakkaf from FabLab UAE with help of Eng Francisco Sanchez from BeachLab
# To work directly it should be saved in the Desktop, and the cloned archive should be saved in Desktop
# This script assumes that the repo name is "fabacademy" and located in the Desktop
# Tested with Manjaro linux
