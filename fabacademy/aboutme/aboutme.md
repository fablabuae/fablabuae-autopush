I am an electrical engineering by profession, maker and open source enthusiastic by passion! I work at FabLab UAE, which is the first educational FabLab in UAE. My goal from joining fabacademy is to learn as much as I can specially using open source software, so I will try to stick to using open soruce software all over fabacademy.
